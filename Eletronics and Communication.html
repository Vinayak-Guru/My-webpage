            <center><h3>About the Department</h3></center>
           <br>
<p>
The course Electronics & Communication was started in the year 1992 with Govt order No.ED 129 TPE 92 dated 12/8/1992 as an unaided course with a seat  ratio 20:80 as Govt:Mgmt. It was started with a intake of 40 but  from 2006-07 the intake has been increased to 120. Now the student strength of the department is 196.   <br>
   <br>
<b> <center><h3>Opportunities of the course </h3></center></b>   <br>
<p>
Electronics & Communication is a branch which is in great demand and students who complete E&C have good opportunities both in Hardware & Software. Application of Electronics in many industries is increasing in present days. Electronics has become a backbone to operate all heavy and light machines used for manufacturing and also use to control different machines.   <br>
Electronics is finding application in industries like Textile, Chemical & Automobile. Students get easy placement after finishing the course. Hubli- Dharwad has been identified as potential area for IT industries as far as infrastructure and Human Resources are concerned. There is a great demand for Hardware technicians and Network Engineers.   <br>
Students of Diploma E&C study subjects such as PC - Hardware and Servicing, Networking, VLSI Designing, PLC, Microcontroller, ARM7 Controller, MAT etc, which are of greater demand in industries.   <br>
